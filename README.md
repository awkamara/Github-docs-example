# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code. A good _Cloud Engineer_ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks (`)
- Not to be confused with single quotation (')

```
# Define an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
sum = 0

# Loop through the array and calculate the sum
numbers.each do |num|
  sum += num
end

# Print the result
puts "The sum of the numbers is: #{sum}"

With backticks
```

- When you can you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting to you codeblocks

 ```ruby
 # Define an array of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
sum = 0

# Loop through the array and calculate the sum
numbers.each do |num|
  sum += num
end

# Print the result
puts "The sum of the numbers is: #{sum}"
```

Make note of where the backtick button is located.
It should appear above the tab key, but it may vary based on your keyboard layout.

Good Cloud Engineers use codeblocks for both Code and Errors that appear in the console.



```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<your_script_name>", line 2, in <module>
    undefined_variable = some_variable + 5
NameError: undefined local variable or method `some_variable' for main:Object
```

> Here is an example of using a codeblock for an error that appears in bash.

## Step 3 - Use Github Flavored Markdown Task Lists

Github extends Markdown to have a list where you can check off items. <sup>[1]</sup>](#external-references)

# Step 4 - Use Emojis (Optional)

GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) supports emoji shortcodes.
Here are some examples:

| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with lighting | `:cloud_with_lighting:` | üå©Ô∏è |

# Step 5 how to create a table


You can use the following markdown format to create tables:

```md
| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with lighting | `:cloud_with_lighting:` | üå©Ô∏è |
```
 Github extends the functionality of Markdown tables to provide alignment and table cell formatting option. [<sup>[2]</sup>](#external-references)
